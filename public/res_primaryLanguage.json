I build useful and visually appealing tools using modern Javascript libraries such as React. Previously, I used to work in roles involving logistics and retail. Working with clients and teams across different businesses has helped me gain a sense of the kind of needs and expectations that users have for different industries and platforms. I'm excited to work on projects that make a strong impact on the world. I'm also a collector of various things, with my most recent interest being headphones! ",
